Preperations
============

To compile speech_tools and festival, you will need almost all GNU file
and shell utilities including sed and a unix shell... phew.  Then,
because of some hardcoded code somewhere, you will need to place rm.exe
and sh.exe in the \bin of the drive where festival has been
uncompressed.  ie.:  /bin/sh and /bin/rm

You will also need GNU Make.  The port of the version 3.76 by Kai Uwe
Rommel will NOT work.  The port of the version 3.75 by the same author
will give Error 255 after making dependencies of each directory, and
will quit but you can rexecute it many times and it will eventually
finish.  For the interested, I have compiled version 3.78.1, and it
worked flawlessly, but it would need to be patched for the usual slash,
backslash, colon and fork() issues to be of any use.

To make sure GNU Make uses the UNIX shell, do a "set COMSPEC=bash"
before using the makefiles.


Code modification
=================

In the current 1.4.1 distribution,  reference to os2audio are missing
in festival\src\arch\festival\festival.cc, speech_tools\audio\audioP.h
and speech_tools\audio\gen_audio.cc. os2_audio.mak is also missing in
festival\config\modules and speech_tools\config\modules.

os2_audio.cc and ix86_OS22.mak also needs an update in speech_tools as
well as gcc27emx.mak and gcc28emx.mak.

A function in audspio.cc can easily be optimised to use spawn() (check
the file named spawn).

audsp.cc can be easily optimized to use threads.  Use the one included.

In speech_tools\config\rules\defaults.mak  line 76 and 83,
add "lib" to "-l" for .a files to work properly with EMX's ld.exe.
